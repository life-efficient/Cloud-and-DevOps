      - correct: true
        option: Runs code in serverless applications

      - correct: true
        option: Can import from adjacent files in the same way as you can locally
      - correct: false

      - correct: true
        option: Can run many different runtimes, including Python 3.8
      - correct: false
        option: AWS Lambda runs the whole script. The usual way to write the code
          is to define a function and call it at the bottom of your script
      - correct: true
        option: In python, you must specify a function which takes in two arguments,
          that will run when the lambda function is triggered
      - correct: true
        option: We call the code in a lambda function a "deployment package"
    question: Which of the following statements are true about AWS Lambda?
  - options:
      - correct: true
        option: Avoid invoking another instance of the same lambda function from within
          one to avoid a cascading large number of invocations
      - correct: false
        option: It's best to leave IAM permissions relatively open in case you decide
          to use other AWS resources from the same account later
      - correct: false
        option: It's best to set a timeout of at least 2x how long you expect your
          lambda function to run for to avoid the function failing if it does take
          that long
      - correct: false
        option: It's best to set a memory limit of at least 2x how much memory you
          expect your lambda function to consume to avoid the function failing if
          it does require that much memory
      - correct: false
        option: You should keep unused lambda functions as a form of version control
      - correct: true
        option: You should define any AWS resource clients (e.g. boto3.client('s3))
          outside of your handler function
      - correct: false
        option: You should define any (requests for) personal information outside
          of your handler function
      - correct: true
        option: Use environment variables to pass constants like a bucket name to
          your function, rather than hard-coding them
    question: Which of the following correctly describe best practices for making
      lambda functions?
  - options:
      - correct: false
        option: No limit on size of lambda layer
      - correct: true
        option: Layers can be uploaded as .zip files or specified as S3 URL locations
      - correct: true
        option: No limit on the number of layers which a lambda function can have
      - correct: false
        option: Layers can reference each other
      - correct: true
        option: We call the code in a lambda layer a "deployment package"
      - correct: true
        option: You can use Lambda Layers created by other AWS accounts than your
          own
      - correct: true
        option: In a Python runtime, the modules boto3, json and os are available
          for import without a lambda layer
      - correct: true
        option: Layers should contain any required 3rd party dependencies not provided
          by default in Lambda functions
      - correct: false
        option: A lambda layer's zipped deployment package should be such that if
          you were to unzip it, it would contain nothing but the source code of the
          dependencies which you want to access
    question: Mark the following statements which are true for AWS Lambda Layers
  - options:
      - correct: true
        option: Item being put in S3
      - correct: false
        option: An EC2 instance, as long as it is created in the same region by the
          same account
      - correct: true
        option: Another lambda function
      - correct: true
        option: Another instance of the same lambda function
      - correct: true
        option: A web request made to an API
      - correct: true
        option: A cron job configured through Cloudwatch Rules
      - correct: false
        option: A web request made directly to the lambda function
      - correct: false
        option: Any other account within your AWS organisation
    question: Which of the following can trigger lambda functions on your AWS account?
